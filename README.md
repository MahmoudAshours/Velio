# Velio

An Android/IOS application project to follow up your progress of online courses.

This is a Solo project test , where the analysis , design , implementation & testing is done by individual.

# Main features 

- The user can add up an online course , for example **"Udemy course for Learning flutter"** . 
- The user can link (sign in) to the course's account .
- The system then automatically calculates : 

- [ ] How many videos are there in the course?
- [ ] Each video's time length.
- [ ] The title of each video.
- [ ] Attached files in the videos.
- [ ] Attached notes in each videos.

- The user suggests number of days to finish the selected course ( i.e 14 days) .
- The system then calculates the minimum amount & maximum amount of videos to finish within one day.
- [ ] Minimum amount is when the total count of videos is (14) and the goal is to take it in (14) days. So the result is 1 video/day.
- [ ] Maximum amount is when the total count of videos is (14) and the goal is to take it in (14) days , but the length of videos is small compared with other videos, So the number of videos daily can increase with certain amount. (i.e. 4 videos/day)

- The project database is done locally using "Hive DB".
